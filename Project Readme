# HairCare

You’ve spent hours combing the internet to find that perfect look. You head off to your local salon and show the stylist the fruits of your online labor. They nod approvingly and lead you back to the chair … only to send you away looking worse than your 6 year old daughter’s least favorite barbie doll after it’s last “spa day”… Sound familiar? There is an unfilled need for a way to connect clients with talented stylists in their area, and HairCare is the app to do it. With HairCare, you can login and see a list of stylists in your area, easily view photos of styles they have done for other customers, upload a photo of your haircut and rate a stylists performance for other users to see. Stylists can also leverage HairCare to gain valuable exposure and establish credibility with nearby customers - upload examples of your past work, and respond to user reviews. Like keeping tabs on what your competion is up to? HairCare has got you covered. With HairCare, you’ll never leave the salon feeling unsatisfied again.
